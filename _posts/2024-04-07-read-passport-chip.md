1. Place your phone flat on the open passport (center pages or inside back cover)
2. Slowly move your phone and stop when progress dots appear (iOS) or the phone vibrates (Android).
3. Leave your phone on your passport until the read is complete.

Chip placement varies, so you may need to try more than one location.
