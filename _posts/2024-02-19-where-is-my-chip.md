# Locating the NFC Chip in Your Passport

## Introduction

The NFC scan only works with biometric passports or e-passports (electronic passports), which contain an RFID chip.
You can confirm that your passport contains an RFID chip by checking the cover for this symbol:

## Find the NFC Chip in Your Passport

The NFC chip in your passport serves as a digital key to your personal data, including your photo, name, date of birth, and more. Locating the chip is the first step in using NFC-enabled services or protecting your passport from unauthorized scanning. The chip can be found in one of several standard locations:

| NFC Chip Location                 |
|-----------------------------------|
| Front cover                       |
| Back cover                        |
| Photo page or biodata page        |
| Dedicated chip page               |

**Note:** Some passports have additional shielding, making it easier to scan the chip from one side than the other. Experiment with your passport to find the most reliable scanning position.
